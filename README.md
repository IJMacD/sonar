sonar
=====

Sonar game testing html5 game system techniques.

This game uses:

* HTML5 canvas
* WebAudio API

Try it
------

Try the game yourself at http://ijmacd.github.io/sonar. Remember your browser must support the features
listed above in order to function correctly.

Currently Chrome and IE latest versions support the full game, Firefox does not support the sound - it will do
when they implement the API of course though.

Bugs
----

Yes there are some.
